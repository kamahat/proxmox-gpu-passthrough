# Troubleshooting Matrix

Symptom-driven entry point. Find your symptom, jump to the fix.

## Code 43 (Device Manager — Windows Guest)

| Vendor | Root Cause | Fix |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| Intel Arc (DG2) | Driver reads CPUID Hypervisor-Running bit (leaf `0x1` ECX bit 31) + Hyper-V Vendor-String | Add `kvm=off,-hypervisor,hv_vendor_id=GenuineIntel` to QEMU args — see [intel-arc-dg2.md § Code-43-Fix](vendors/intel-arc-dg2.md#code-43-fix) |
| NVIDIA Consumer (driver ≥ 465.89, April 2021+) | **Should not happen** | Check driver version — older driver needs `kvm=off`; new driver supports passthrough natively |
| NVIDIA Consumer (driver < 465.89) | Active anti-VM check | Upgrade driver; interim fix `-cpu host,kvm=off,hv_vendor_id=GenuineIntel` |
| NVIDIA Pro / Ada | Shouldn't happen | Verify you're using NVIDIA Pro/RTX Enterprise driver, not mistakenly Consumer Game Ready |
| AMD | Rarely Code 43 specifically; more likely reset-failure | See "Host hangs on second VM start" below |

## DxgKrnl-Admin Event 549 (Windows)

> Event ID 549 is an observed value in Microsoft-Windows-DxgKrnl/Admin.
> Microsoft does not publish an official event-ID reference for this channel,
> but the ID has been consistent across all reported Arc-DG2 Code-43 cases.

| Message | Root Cause | Fix |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| `E_NOINTERFACE` / "Schnittstelle nicht unterstützt" | Hypervisor visible to driver, WDDM interface mismatch | Add `-hypervisor` to QEMU args (not just `kvm=off`) |
| `STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL` / "Vorgang fehlgeschlagen" | KVM hidden but Hyper-V enlightenments missing | Add `hv_relaxed,hv_spinlocks=0x1fff` |
| `STATUS_TIMEOUT` | PCI reset failed, device didn't respond | Install reset-method hookscript |

## Device Shows as "Microsoft Basic Display Adapter"

| Vendor | Likely Cause | Fix |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| Intel Arc | Wrong INF installed (`iigd_dch.inf` for iGPU instead of `iigd_dch_d.inf` for discrete) | `pnputil /delete-driver oemXX.inf /uninstall /force` + reinstall `iigd_dch_d.inf` — see [intel-arc-dg2.md § INF Gotcha](vendors/intel-arc-dg2.md#inf-gotcha-iigd_dch_dinf-vs-iigd_dchinf) |
| Any | Driver install failed silently | Check `pnputil /enum-drivers`, re-run installer with logging |
| Any | Device has Code 43 — Windows falls back to basic driver | Fix Code 43 first (see above) |

## VM Won't Start — Proxmox Errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `Could not assign device 0000:XX:00.X, error -22` | IOMMU group contains device still bound to host driver | `./scripts/check-iommu-groups.sh` — bind all group members to vfio-pci |
| `vfio-pci: not enough MMIO resources for MSI-X` | Above 4G Decoding disabled in BIOS | Enable in firmware, reboot |
| `error writing '1' to /sys/.../reset: Inappropriate ioctl for device` | GPU doesn't support Proxmox's default reset method | Install reset-method hookscript — see [HOST_SETUP.md § Step 7](HOST_SETUP.md#step-7--optional-install-reset-method-hookscript) |
| `failed to initialize device in group N` | Companion device (audio, USB-C controller) not bound to vfio-pci | Add all companion vendor:device IDs to `/etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf` |

## Host Hangs on Second VM Start

Typically **AMD Reset Bug**. The GPU was left in an unreclaimable state after the first VM shutdown.

| GPU Family | Fix |
|------------|-----|
| AMD Polaris (RX 4xx/5xx) | Install [vendor-reset](https://github.com/gnif/vendor-reset) kernel module |
| AMD Navi (RX 5xxx) | Install `vendor-reset` (Navi-specific reset sequence) |
| AMD RDNA 2+ (RX 6xxx/7xxx) | Usually better behaved, but `vendor-reset` still recommended |
| Intel / NVIDIA | Not a Reset Bug — check dmesg for specific error (see WPR2 section below for Blackwell) |

## NVIDIA Blackwell: "GPU Failed to Initialize" on Second VM Start (WPR2 Reset Bug)

**Symptom**: VM starts cleanly the first time. After VM shutdown and restart, the GPU fails to initialize. `dmesg` in the guest shows errors during `nvidia.ko` load; the guest sees the GPU but NVIDIA driver can't bring it up. `nvidia-smi` returns `Failed to initialize NVML: Driver/library version mismatch` or hangs. The Proxmox host is not hung — only the passthrough GPU is unrecoverable without a host reboot.

**Root cause**: NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs use a **GSP (GPU System Processor)** firmware that maintains a **Write-Protected Region 2 (WPR2)**. When the VM shuts down, the GSP firmware does not fully reset — its WPR2 state persists in the GPU's on-chip SRAM across PCIe FLR (Function Level Reset). The next VM boot sees the GPU with leftover firmware state and can't re-initialize from scratch.

This is distinct from the AMD Reset Bug (different mechanism, different fix):

| Aspect | AMD Reset Bug | NVIDIA Blackwell WPR2 Bug |
|--------|--------------|--------------------------|
| Trigger | GPU left in bad state after any VM exit | GSP firmware WPR2 persists through PCIe FLR |
| Host hangs? | Yes — host often deadlocks | No — host is fine, only GPU unusable |
| PCIe FLR fix? | Sometimes | No — FLR is insufficient |
| D3cold (power-cycle via PCIe) | Not always supported | Not supported on most desktop platforms |
| Fix | `vendor-reset` kernel module | Full host reboot (short-term); `vendor-reset` Blackwell support (long-term — check [gnif/vendor-reset](https://github.com/gnif/vendor-reset) issues for Blackwell status) |

**Short-term fix** (confirmed working):

```bash
# From the Proxmox host — issue a full reboot
# (A VM stop/start cycle is NOT enough; the GPU needs power-cycle via host reboot)
ssh proxmox-host "nohup reboot &"
```

After the host reboots, the GPU resets cleanly and the VM starts normally again.

**Long-term fix**: Install [gnif/vendor-reset](https://github.com/gnif/vendor-reset) as a DKMS module on the Proxmox host. `vendor-reset` implements GPU-family-specific reset sequences that go beyond PCIe FLR. Check the issue tracker for Blackwell (GB2xx/GB3xx) support status — Ada Lovelace support is available, Blackwell may require a newer version.

```bash
# On Proxmox host:
apt install dkms git
git clone https://github.com/gnif/vendor-reset.git
cd vendor-reset && dkms install .
modprobe vendor_reset
# Verify: dmesg | grep vendor_reset
```

The Proxmox `reset-method` hookscript (`hookscripts/reset-method.sh` in this repo) plugs into vendor-reset automatically if the module is present.

## Wrong VRAM Reported

| Tool | Reports | Reality |
|------|---------|---------|
| WMI `Win32_VideoController.AdapterRAM` | 32-bit field; tools show ~2 GB (signed int32, e.g. `2147479552`) or ~4 GB (unsigned uint32) depending on interpretation | 32-bit WMI field limit — **not real VRAM** for any card >2 GB |
| Device Manager → Properties → Adapter | Varies | Driver-reported, usually correct |
| DXGI `IDXGIAdapter1::GetDesc1 → DedicatedVideoMemory` (P/Invoke) | Actual value as `SIZE_T` (64-bit on x64) | **Authoritative** — no field-width caps, no external-tool dependency (see `scripts/capability-probe.ps1` section 3a) |
| `dxdiag /t file.txt` → `Dedicated Memory:` | Actual value | Authoritative fallback when P/Invoke isn't an option |
| NVIDIA `nvidia-smi` (in VM) | Actual value | Authoritative for NVIDIA |

Prefer DXGI (or vendor tool); `dxdiag` is the fallback; `Win32_VideoController.AdapterRAM` is never reliable for cards >2 GB.

## Vulkan Applications Can't Find GPU

| Vendor | Symptom | Fix |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Intel Arc (pnputil-installed) | `VK_ERROR_INCOMPATIBLE_DRIVER`, `vulkaninfo` says "Devices: 0" | Manually register ICD — see [intel-arc-dg2.md § Vulkan ICD Registration](vendors/intel-arc-dg2.md#vulkan-icd-registration-pnputil-gotcha) |
| NVIDIA | `vulkan-1.dll` not found | Driver didn't install System32 Vulkan loader — reinstall NVIDIA driver |
| Any | ICD registered but Vulkan apps still fail | Check `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Khronos\Vulkan\Drivers` has entry pointing to existing JSON |

## Resolution Stuck at 1024×768 or 800×600

Almost always "GPU shows as Microsoft Basic Display Adapter" (see above). Fix the driver binding; real resolution follows.

## Guest Performance Much Lower Than Bare-Metal

| Cause | Diagnostic | Fix |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| ReBAR not exposed | `dxdiag` shows VRAM < 4 GB on a 4+ GB card | Enable Resizable BAR in host BIOS; verify with `lspci -vv -s <BDF>` showing full BAR size |
| CPU not `host` model | `qm config <vmid>` shows different `--cpu` | `qm set <vmid> --cpu host` |
| Ballooning active | `qm config <vmid>` shows `balloon: <non-zero>` | `qm set <vmid> --balloon 0` |
| IO Thread disabled on storage | slow disk IO while GPU idle | `qm set <vmid> --scsi0 ...,iothread=1` |
| Memory fragmentation (huge pages) | Inconsistent performance | Enable `hugepages` via Proxmox config or kernel boot |

## GPU Fans Spin Full Speed

Fan controller usually lives on the GPU itself and is driven by the guest driver. On first boot with no driver loaded, fans may default to 100%. Should normalize once driver loads.

If fans stay full after driver loads:
- **NVIDIA**: driver fan curve might not apply; check GPU-Z / nvidia-smi for temperature
- **Intel Arc**: known issue on some boards with BIOS-side fan control conflicting with driver; usually resolves after one VM reboot
- **AMD**: check for `vendor-reset` leaving GPU in weird state

## nvidia-smi Reports "No devices found" (Linux Guest — Blackwell / Ada)

**Symptom**: `nvidia-smi` returns `No devices found` or `No devices were found`. The NVIDIA kernel module *is* loaded (`lsmod | grep nvidia` shows `nvidia`, `nvidia_uvm`, etc.), and `lspci` shows the GPU. `dmesg` contains:

```
NVRM: The NVIDIA GPU 0000:XX:00.0 (PCI ID: 10de:XXXX)
NVRM: installed in this system requires use of the NVIDIA open kernel modules.
NVRM: GPU 0000:XX:00.0: RmInitAdapter failed! (0x22:0x56:1017)
NVRM: GPU 0000:XX:00.0: rm_init_adapter failed, device minor number 0
```

**Root cause**: Blackwell (GB2xx/GB3xx) and Ada Lovelace GPUs require NVIDIA's open-source kernel modules. The proprietary closed-source `nvidia.ko` does not support these architectures. The standard `nvidia-driver-XXX-server` (or `nvidia-driver-XXX`) package installs the closed module.

**Fix**:

```bash
# Ubuntu 24.04 — swap closed for open kernel module package
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-595-server-open
# apt automatically removes nvidia-driver-595-server and rebuilds via DKMS

# Hot-reload without VM reboot:
sudo modprobe -r nvidia_uvm nvidia_drm nvidia_modeset nvidia
sudo modprobe nvidia
# Verify:
nvidia-smi
```

Replace `595` with your installed driver version. The open package variant is named `nvidia-driver-<VERSION>-open` (desktop) or `nvidia-driver-<VERSION>-server-open` (server/headless).

**Affected architectures**: All Blackwell (GB1xx/GB2xx/GB3xx) and Ada Lovelace (AD1xx) GPUs. Turing (TU1xx) and Ampere (GA1xx) still work with either open or closed modules.

**Live VFIO bind note**: If you update `vfio.conf` with new device IDs but don't reboot, the running `vfio-pci` kernel module instance doesn't know the new IDs. `echo <BDF> > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/vfio-pci/bind` will fail with `No such device`. Use `new_id` instead:

```bash
echo "10de 2c31" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/vfio-pci/new_id   # RTX PRO 4500 GPU
echo "10de 22e9" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/vfio-pci/new_id   # RTX PRO 4500 Audio
# The driver claims the devices automatically after new_id
```

## Still Stuck?

1. Run `./scripts/collect-diagnostics.sh <vmid>` — bundles IOMMU groups, VFIO state, VM config, dmesg
2. Open an issue with the bundle attached (sanitize IPs/hostnames first)
3. Check the [Proxmox Forum](https://forum.proxmox.com/forums/) — search for "PCI passthrough" / "VFIO" — lots of historical threads
4. For AMD / VFIO deep-dives: [Level1Techs Forum VFIO category](https://forum.level1techs.com/c/software/linux/vfio-passthrough/146)
